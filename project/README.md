# Call Routing Project

This was a system design challenge completed for `CS 1.3 - Data Structures and Algorithms` to emphasize problem solving in different contexts, good use of data structures and attention to time and space complexity.

For this assignment we were given three scenarios as follows: 

### Description

This project is inspired by a real-world problem at a telephony API company â€“ let's call it Teleo. The primary task is to implement an international phone call routing system that finds the least cost route through multiple carriers. One of the goals of this project is to demonstrate the wide variety of solutions and compare the tradeoffs with each.

### Challenges

These challenges are the baseline required to complete the project. Be sure to complete these before before starting on the stretch challenges below.

**Scenario 1: One-time route cost check**

You have a carrier route list with 100,000 (100K) entries (in arbitrary order) and a single phone number. How quickly can you find the cost of calling this number?

**Scenario 2: List of route costs to check**

You have a carrier route list with 100,000 (100K) entries (in arbitrary order) and a list of 1000 phone numbers. How can you operationalize the route cost lookup problem?

**Scenario 3: Multiple long carrier route lists**

You have 5 carrier route lists, each with 10,000,000 (10M) entries (in arbitrary order) and a list of 10,000 phone numbers. How can you speed up your route cost lookup solution to handle this larger dataset?

### Complexity Analysis

Annotate each function with complexity analysis of running time and space (memory)
